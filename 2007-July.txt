Subject: [Windstille-devel] Txt2image conversion (Text2png.cpp)
Message-ID: <1672F418EEFEEF449C42C89BB50DCCEE02D95097@aghesexg01.agcocorp.com>

Dear Developer at Windstelle:

I am new to this mailing list. I am interested to find some open source to
convert a text file into a jpg or tiff image so a portable photo printer can
print it out.  I did a code search in koders.com

http://www.koders.com/cpp/fidEC2143FDBF5639DECDB6DDD558B93037B911CF8D.aspx?s
=text2image+
<http://www.koders.com/cpp/fidEC2143FDBF5639DECDB6DDD558B93037B911CF8D.aspx?
s=text2image+> 

It seemed to me 
	txt2png.cpp
</cpp/fidEC2143FDBF5639DECDB6DDD558B93037B911CF8D.aspx?s=text2image+> 
and several other files under txt2png folder will do the text to image
conversion.

I downloaded windstille-0.3.0.tar.bz2
<http://download2.berlios.de/windstille/windstille-0.3.0.tar.bz2>  and sever
other packages listed under the download page but neither of the package
include txt2pgn.cpp.
I tried to use SVN to check out the code from the main trunk:
	svn co svn://svn.berlios.de/windstille/trunk/ 
However,  my svn client always failed in connecting to the SVN server (I am
in US).
Can anybody help:
	a. Whether txtpgn.cpp will do the text2image conversion?
	b. Why the txt2pgn.cpp is not included in the bz2 or winZip package?
	c. How can I download the whole source including txt2pgn.cpp?
Thanks in advance,
