Subject: [Windstille-devel] Collision-Detection and Physics
Message-ID: <1126954027.7986.4.camel@taylor>

Hi,

I was trying to implement some simple physics behaviour (bouncing when
hitting a wall). But I can't manage to get it working with the current
collision code, it always ends in hundrets of similar collisions and
finally a "too much tries in collision detection".
I committed the code to svn, just load the industrial level and press
the "aim" button and you should see a grenade appear and fall down
slowly, as soon as it hits something you'll be flooded by collision
messages.

Could you take a look at it David?

Greetings,
