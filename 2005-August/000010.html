&gt;<i> As for grumbel's question concerning the contact-API, I'd add:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Signal_v1&lt;CollisionObject&amp;&gt; on_contact
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Signal_v1&lt;CollisionObject&amp;&gt; on_contact_lost
</I>&gt;<i> to CollisionObject, which are called whenever a contact happens and when it's 
</I>&gt;<i> lost.
</I>
on_contact() seems unneeded since a contact is something that the
GameObject should create itself when colliding with another object,
its not something that automatically happens, but something that
is requested. We also need a class representing the contact itself,
something like:

class Contact
{
        enum Axis { X_AXIS, Y_AXIS };
        enum Mode { FULL, HALF, NONE };

        Axis axis;
        Mode mode;
};

Where Axis tells you if its a contact on the x-axis (ie. walking on
the ground) or y-axis (climbing up a ledder) (might need
UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT here instead of just axis).

And where Mode tells you when you lose the contact (this could also be
added as data to the on_contact_lost callback, so that the gameobject
can decide in the callback if the contact is really lost), Mode refers
to the following situations:

Full Contact, contact is lost as soon as the object no longer fully
overlaps with the ground

 +----+
 |    |
 |    |
 +----+
------+
      |
      |


Half Contact, contact is lost when the object no longer overlaps more
then 50% with the ground.

    +----+
    |    |
    |    |
    +----+
------+
      |
      |

None Contact, contact is lost when the object is 100% clear from the
ground (this is what SuperTux uses)

      +----+
      |    |
      |    |
      +----+
------+
      |
      |

&gt;&gt;<i> 1. when jump is pressed, search for nearby climbable things a short
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distance above our head
</I>
Yes, this is needed. Animation should whenever possible be
'context-aware', so that you for example might play another anim for
missing a ledge then for grabbing one. It also allows to move the
player closer to the edge while jumping.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. if something climbable is found close by, automatically move the player
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> underneath it and jump
</I>
Best way would be to move the player closer while jumping and not just
plop him into the right possition while starting the jump.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. At the top of the jump freeze the player in position and switch to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hanging animation
</I>
Yep.

&gt;&gt;<i> 4. If whilst in this position the player pushes up, play the climbing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> animation and move the player on to the new platform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This strikes me as an outstandingly hard task, is anyone working on this?
</I>
Doesn't sound that hard, just a bit tricky to get everything right.

&gt;&gt;<i> If not, can we not bodge some sort of shortcut?
</I>&gt;<i> We could leave out step 1 for a start.
</I>
1) sounds pretty easy, just search for a edge in the tilemap, simple
for-loop across a small area above the player should give you the
available edges then you only need to find out which are close enough.
We could even add special tileflags to mark edges if that helps.
