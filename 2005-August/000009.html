<PRE>As for grumbel's question concerning the contact-API, I'd add:
1) Signal_v1&lt;CollisionObject&amp;&gt; on_contact
2) Signal_v1&lt;CollisionObject&amp;&gt; on_contact_lost
to CollisionObject, which are called whenever a contact happens and when it's 
lost.

&gt;<i> Do we yet have a plan for how we are going to do this?
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that because a) you need to be directly underneath a platform
</I>&gt;<i> to be bale to jump on it but b) we have pixel by pixel movement, we need to
</I>&gt;<i> do something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. when jump is pressed, search for nearby climbable things a short
</I>&gt;<i> distance above our head
</I>This is not so easy. Tilemap and simple objects must be searched for a free 
edge. This would be Flashback's style of movement. We could apart from this,
add some tolerance to the clinging to the edge for a start.
&gt;<i> 2. if something climbable is found close by, automatically move the player
</I>&gt;<i> underneath it and jump
</I>That would be a nice test for the parent/child behaviour of CollisionObject.
As soon as the player is clinging to the platform, he gets a child of the 
elevator and is then moved with it. For the up-climbing animation, the 
player's position would then lineary moved up. In the meantime the 
finger-collision-rectangle would remain on the edge of the platform.

After the upmovement the player has to move a little sideways.

&gt;<i> 3. At the top of the jump freeze the player in position and switch to the
</I>&gt;<i> hanging animation
</I>&gt;<i> 4. If whilst in this position the player pushes up, play the climbing
</I>&gt;<i> animation and move the player on to the new platform
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This strikes me as an outstandingly hard task, is anyone working on this?
</I>No, at least not me.

&gt;<i> If not, can we not bodge some sort of shortcut?
</I>We could leave out step 1 for a start.
