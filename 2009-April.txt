I couldn't help but notice you've been making a lot of commits to
Windstille recently, grumbel.

Are you working on a release or just doing some random hacking?

At the moment I'm mostly work on the editor, not so much on the game
itself, so a new release is still quite far away, as the game will
need some rather large changes before it gets truly playable with the
changed level structure (no longer using tilemaps). You can check for
updates at:

I just had a chance to take a look and the editor is coming along
quite nicely (and quickly). Good work.

I would prefer something more like Telltale with regular and more
conclusive releases, but yeah, it might easily end up more like Half
Life's episodic content where releases come only out very randomly.

Well, I didn't say that a job change should happen due to boredom/pay,
fell free to invent something more interesting, all I am saying is
that I really don't like previous job giver starting an assassination
attempt on Jane early on in the game. Later on in the game there might
be enough reason for that, but early on it just wouldn't make much
sense and as said would also be pretty primitive.
