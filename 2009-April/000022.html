<PRE>2009/4/10 David Mills &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/windstille-devel">d.mills at guesny.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> AKA Half-life? I was thinking along those lines too.
</I>
I would prefer something more like Telltale with regular and more
conclusive releases, but yeah, it might easily end up more like Half
Life's episodic content where releases come only out very randomly.

&gt;&gt;<i> My problem with that is that its a simple one dimensional and to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direct. An alternative solution for example could be that the work is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more dangerous then it used to be due to NStar running low on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resources, not having the material to properly secure the mines,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having to improvise and as a result more accidents happen. Down the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> road it could of course could still be greed with RedStar using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> materials for their own mines, raising prices above what NStar can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> afford and such or whatever, but it would be much more indirect and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people wouldn't necessarily know the consequences of their actions. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would just be people doing their jobs as good as they can and trouble
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would still arise, due to their actions having unforeseen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consequences. This could also lead to false suspicion and hate, i.e.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the miners would blame RedStar for the trouble, while in reality they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves might have good reason why the material is on short supply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and as expensive as it is.
</I>
&gt;<i> I see your point, but I'd prefer it if Jane's change of job was motivated by
</I>&gt;<i> something other than boredom/pay.
</I>
Well, I didn't say that a job change should happen due to boredom/pay,
fell free to invent something more interesting, all I am saying is
that I really don't like previous job giver starting an assassination
attempt on Jane early on in the game. Later on in the game there might
be enough reason for that, but early on it just wouldn't make much
sense and as said would also be pretty primitive.

PS: We should move this discussion to the mailing list:
